### How to Contribute

### Quality Standards

Resources added to this list should:

- **Be relevant** to accessibility, assistive technology, or inclusive design
- **Be high-quality** and well-maintained
- **Be accessible** themselves (practice what they preach)
- **Provide value** to developers, designers, or accessibility practitioners

### Style Guidelines

#### Formatting

- Use **Markdown** formatting consistently
- Keep descriptions **concise** (1-2 sentences)
- Use **sentence case** for titles
- Include **direct links** to resources
- Maintain **alphabetical order** within sections (where applicable)

#### Descriptions

- Start with what the resource **is** or **does**
- Explain **why it's useful**
- Keep it **objective** and **factual**
- Avoid marketing language or hype

Example:
```markdown
- [Resource Name](https://example.com) - Brief description of what it is and why it's valuable for accessibility work.
```

### Categories

Resources should be placed in appropriate categories:

- **Tools** - Software, browser extensions, testing tools
- **Guidelines** - Standards, best practices, documentation
- **Learning** - Tutorials, courses, educational resources
- **Communities** - Forums, groups, organizations
- **Blogs & Articles** - Written content and publications
- **Videos & Podcasts** - Multimedia educational content
- **Books** - Published books on accessibility
- **Assistive Technology** - Screen readers, input devices, etc.

If a resource doesn't fit existing categories, suggest a new category in your pull request.
