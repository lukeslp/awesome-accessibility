Contributions to improve descriptions, organization, or formatting are also welcome:

### Quality Standards

Resources on this list should:

- **Be relevant** to accessibility, assistive technology, or inclusive design
- **Be high-quality** and well-maintained
- **Be accessible** themselves (practice what they preach)
- **Provide value** to developers, designers, or accessibility practitioners
- **Be current** and actively updated

### Style Guidelines

#### Formatting

- Use Markdown formatting
- Keep descriptions concise (1-2 sentences)
- Use sentence case for titles
- Include direct links
- Maintain alphabetical order within sections where it makes sense

#### Descriptions

- Start with what the resource is or does
- Explain why it's useful
- Keep it objective
- Avoid marketing language

Example:
```markdown
- [Resource Name](https://example.com) - Brief description of what it is and why it's valuable for accessibility work.
```

### Categories

Resources should be placed in appropriate categories:

- **Tools** - Software, browser extensions, testing tools
- **Guidelines** - Standards, best practices, documentation
- **Learning** - Tutorials, courses, educational resources
- **Communities** - Forums, groups, organizations
- **Blogs & Articles** - Written content and publications
- **Videos & Podcasts** - Multimedia educational content
- **Books** - Published books on accessibility
- **Assistive Technology** - Screen readers, input devices, etc.

If a resource doesn't fit an existing category, suggest a new one in your pull request.
