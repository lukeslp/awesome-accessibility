# Awesome Accessibility  •  [![Awesome](https://awesome.re/badge.svg)](https://awesome.re) 

Accessibility is about inclusive design and ensuring technology can be used by anyone, regardless of ability or disability. My mission is to make this repository a gateway for high-quality open source resources, tools, and knowledge that help make technology accessible and empower users.




## Why Accessibility Matters

Accessibility is essential for upholding diversity and human rights in our digital world. By designing solutions usable by all, we can build a society that values each person's unique contributions.

**"For some people technology makes things easier, for others it makes things possible."**




## My Mission

I invite developers, designers, educators, and all accessibility advocates to contribute to this repository. Please share your suggestions, corrections, and techniques for empowering users through inclusive technology. Together, we can enhance accessibility for everyone.
